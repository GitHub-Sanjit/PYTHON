# Using list comprehensions:

answer = [person[0] for person in ["Elie", "Tim", "Matt"]]
answer2 = [val for val in [1,2,3,4,5,6] if val % 2 == 0]
# Using good old manual loops:

answer = []
for person in ["Elie", "Tim", "Matt"]:
    answer.append(person[0])
answer2 = []
for num in [1,2,3,4,5,6]:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        answer2.append(num)
        
        
        
# Using list comprehensions(the more Pythonic way): 

answer = [val for val in [1,2,3,4] if val in [3,4,5,6]]
#the slice [::-1] is a quick way to reverse a string
answer2 = [val[::-1].lower() for val in ["Elie", "Tim", "Matt"]]
# Without list comprehensions, things are a bit longer:

answer = []
for x in [1,2,3,4]:
    if x in [3,4,5,6]:
        answer.append(x)
answer2 = []
for name in ["Elie", "Tim", "Matt"]:
    answer2.append(name[::-1].lower())
    
    
    
# Nice and short using a list comprehension: 

answer = [val for val in range(1,101) if val % 12 == 0] 



# Using a string (preferable solution):

answer = [char for char in "amazing" if char not in "aeiou"] 

# Using a list:

answer = [char for char in "amazing" if char not in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]] 

answer = [[i for i in range(0,3)] for num in range(0,3)] 



# To generate the following using a nested list comprehension:

[
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 ]
# My solution looks like this:

answer = [[i for i in range(0,10)] for num in range(0,10)]
